<p>We can better manage our lives by keeping track of a schedule of
tasks.
A task can be scheduled on a certain day, and within a time period.
Recurring tasks can also be scheduled which occurs for a
number of times based on a certain frequency. 
You may assume that all tasks are scheduled within a month.

<h2>Task</h2>

<p>Your task is to manage single-session tasks, as well as recurring tasks within a planner.

<h2>Take note!</h2>

<p>There are altogether five levels.
You are required to complete ALL levels.</p>

<p>You should keep to the constructs and programming discipline 
instilled throughout the module.</p>

<ul>
<li>Write each <tt>class</tt>/<tt>interface</tt> in its own file.
DO NOT use <tt>enum</tt></li>.
<li>Ensure that ALL object properties and class constants are declared <tt>private final</tt>. </li>
<li>Ensure that that your classes are NOT cyclic dependent.</li>
<li>You are NOT allowed to use java libraries, other than those
from <tt>java.lang</tt>, <tt>java.util.List</tt> and
<tt>java.util.Comparator</tt>.</li>
<li>Use only the <tt>ImList</tt> class provided with this question. 
<li>You are NOT allowed to use java keywords/literals: <tt>null</tt>, <tt>instanceof</tt>
<li>You are NOT allowed to use Java reflection, i.e. <tt>Object::getClasses</tt> and other methods from <tt>Class</tt>
<li>You are NOT allowed to use <tt>*</tt> wildcard imports.
<li>You are NOT allowed to use explicit typecasts to convert between
types.
<li>You are NOT allowed to define anonymous inner classes, or lambdas.
<li>You are NOT allowed to define array constructs, e.g.
<tt>String[]</tt> or using ellipsis, e.g.<tt>String...</tt>
</ul>

<p>You may assume that all tests provide valid arguments to methods; hence there is no need to validate method arguments. </li>


<h2>Level 1</h2>

<p>Write a class <tt>Task</tt> with a constructor that takes in three
integers (the day, the start time and the end time) followed by a
description of the task.

<p>You will also need to include the following methods:

<ul>
<li>an <tt>edit</tt> method that allow the task to be
rescheduled within the same day, by taking in the start time and the end time.
<li>a <tt>cancel</tt> method to denote that the task is cancelled.
</ul>

<pre>
$ javac your_java_files
$ jshell your_java_files_in_bottom-up_dependency_order
jshell&gt; Task t = new Task(1, 12, 14, "lunch with boss")
t ==&gt; Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss

jshell&gt; t.edit(13, 14)
$.. ==&gt; Task: 1,13,14,lunch with boss

jshell&gt; t
t ==&gt; Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss

jshell&gt; t = t.edit(13, 14)
t ==&gt; Task: 1,13,14,lunch with boss

jshell&gt; t.cancel()
$.. ==&gt; Task: 1,13,14,lunch with boss[cancelled]

jshell&gt; t.cancel().edit(12, 14)
|  Error:
|  cannot find symbol
|    symbol:   method edit(int,int)
|  t.cancel().edit(12, 14)
|  ^-------------^

jshell&gt; t.cancel().cancel()
|  Error:
|  cannot find symbol
|    symbol:   method cancel()
|  t.cancel().cancel()
|  ^---------------^
</pre>

<p>Note that a cancelled task cannot be edited nor cancelled again.


<h2>Level 2</h2>

<p>Define a <tt>RecurringTask</tt> class that creates a recurring
task with a constructor that takes in a task, followed by the
frequency and the number of occurrences.

<p>The following example shows a recurrence of a weekly task (7 days)
for four occurrences.

<pre>
$ javac your_java_files
$ jshell your_java_files_in_bottom-up_dependency_order
jshell&gt; Task t = new Task(1,12,14,"lunch with boss")
t ==&gt; Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss

jshell&gt; new RecurringTask(t, 7, 4)
$.. ==&gt; Recurring Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss
#1:Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss
#2:Task: 8,12,14,lunch with boss
#3:Task: 15,12,14,lunch with boss
#4:Task: 22,12,14,lunch with boss
</pre>


<p>Just like a normal task, a recurring task can be editted and
cancelled:

<pre>
jshell&gt; RecurringTask rt = new RecurringTask(t, 7, 4)
rt ==&gt; Recurring Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss
#1:Task:  ... : 22,12,14,lunch with boss

jshell&gt; t.cancel() // this is cancelling t, not rt!
$.. ==&gt; Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss[cancelled]

jshell&gt; rt // rt is not affected by cancelling t!
rt ==&gt; Recurring Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss
#1:Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss
#2:Task: 8,12,14,lunch with boss
#3:Task: 15,12,14,lunch with boss
#4:Task: 22,12,14,lunch with boss

jshell&gt; rt.cancel()
$.. ==&gt; Recurring Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss[cancelled]

jshell&gt; rt.cancel().cancel()
|  Error:
|  cannot find symbol
|    symbol:   method cancel()
|  rt.cancel().cancel()
|  ^----------------^

jshell&gt; rt.cancel().edit()
|  Error:
|  cannot find symbol
|    symbol:   method edit()
|  rt.cancel().edit()
|  ^--------------^

jshell&gt; rt.edit(11, 13)
$.. ==&gt; Recurring Task: 1,11,13,lunch with boss
#1:Task: 1,11,13,lunch with boss
#2:Task: 8,11,13,lunch with boss
#3:Task: 15,11,13,lunch with boss
#4:Task: 22,11,13,lunch with boss

jshell&gt; rt.edit(11, 13).cancel()
$.. ==&gt; Recurring Task: 1,11,13,lunch with boss[cancelled]
</pre>

<h2>Level 3</h2>

<p>Rather than batch-editing or batch-cancelling all occurrences of a recurring task, we
would like to edit or cancel one of them.  We do that by specifying the index as the
first argument to the <tt>cancel</tt> or <tt>edit</tt> methods:

<p>The following shows how the single-argument <tt>cancel</tt> method works:

<pre>
$ javac your_java_files
$ jshell your_java_files_in_bottom-up_dependency_order
jshell&gt; Task t = new Task(1,12,14,"lunch with boss")
t ==&gt; Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss

jshell&gt; new RecurringTask(t, 7, 4).cancel(1)
$.. ==&gt; Recurring Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss
#1:Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss[cancelled]
#2:Task: 8,12,14,lunch with boss
#3:Task: 15,12,14,lunch with boss
#4:Task: 22,12,14,lunch with boss

jshell&gt; new RecurringTask(t, 7, 4).cancel(1).cancel(1)
$.. ==&gt; Recurring Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss
#1:Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss[cancelled]
#2:Task: 8,12,14,lunch with boss
#3:Task: 15,12,14,lunch with boss
#4:Task: 22,12,14,lunch with boss

jshell&gt; new RecurringTask(t, 7, 4).cancel(1).cancel(3)
$.. ==&gt; Recurring Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss
#1:Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss[cancelled]
#2:Task: 8,12,14,lunch with boss
#3:Task: 15,12,14,lunch with boss[cancelled]
#4:Task: 22,12,14,lunch with boss
</pre>

<p>When editing a single occurrence of a recurring task, we are allowed to edit the day, start time and end time.

<pre>
jshell&gt; new RecurringTask(t, 7, 4).edit(3, 10, 8, 10) // edit third occurrence to day 10, start 8, end 10
$.. ==&gt; Recurring Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss
#1:Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss
#2:Task: 8,12,14,lunch with boss
#3:Task: 10,8,10,lunch with boss
#4:Task: 22,12,14,lunch with boss

jshell&gt; new RecurringTask(t, 7, 4).edit(3, 5, 8, 10)
$.. ==&gt; Recurring Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss
#1:Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss
#2:Task: 5,8,10,lunch with boss
#3:Task: 8,12,14,lunch with boss
#4:Task: 22,12,14,lunch with boss
</pre>

<p>Notice in the last test that editing the schedule of one occurrence of a
recurring task may require the recurring tasks to be re-ordered in chronological order.

<p>Moreover, unlike cancelling all occurrences of a recurring task, 
a specific occurrence of a recurring task that has been cancelled
can be re-edited.

<pre>
jshell&gt; new RecurringTask(t, 7, 4).cancel(3)
$.. ==&gt; Recurring Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss
#1:Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss
#2:Task: 8,12,14,lunch with boss
#3:Task: 15,12,14,lunch with boss[cancelled]
#4:Task: 22,12,14,lunch with boss

jshell&gt; new RecurringTask(t, 7, 4).cancel(3).edit(3, 10, 8, 10)
$.. ==&gt; Recurring Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss
#1:Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss
#2:Task: 8,12,14,lunch with boss
#3:Task: 10,8,10,lunch with boss
#4:Task: 22,12,14,lunch with boss
</pre>

<p>Here is what happens when we try to cancel/edit one occurrence of a recurring task that has already
been batch-cancelled via <tt>cancel()</tt>.

<pre>
jshell&gt; new RecurringTask(t, 7, 4).cancel(3).edit(3, 10, 8, 10).cancel().edit(1, 2, 3, 4)
|  Error:
|  cannot find symbol
|    symbol:   method edit(int,int,int,int)
|  new RecurringTask(t, 7, 4).cancel(3).edit(3, 10, 8, 10).cancel().edit(1, 2, 3, 4)
|  ^-------------------------------------------------------------------^

jshell&gt; new RecurringTask(t, 7, 4).cancel(3).edit(3, 10, 8, 10).cancel().cancel(1)
|  Error:
|  cannot find symbol
|    symbol:   method cancel(int)
|  new RecurringTask(t, 7, 4).cancel(3).edit(3, 10, 8, 10).cancel().cancel(1)
|  ^---------------------------------------------------------------------^
</pre>

<p>The last example below shows the effect of batch editing after a single occurrence cancel/edit.
Notice that edit is based upon the original specification of the recurring task.
<pre>
jshell&gt; new RecurringTask(t, 7, 4)
$.. ==&gt; Recurring Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss // this is the original specification
#1:Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss
#2:Task: 8,12,14,lunch with boss
#3:Task: 15,12,14,lunch with boss
#4:Task: 22,12,14,lunch with boss

jshell&gt; new RecurringTask(t, 7, 4).cancel(3).edit(3, 10, 8, 10).edit(14, 15)
$.. ==&gt; Recurring Task: 1,14,15,lunch with boss
#1:Task: 1,14,15,lunch with boss
#2:Task: 8,14,15,lunch with boss
#3:Task: 15,14,15,lunch with boss
#4:Task: 22,14,15,lunch with boss
</pre>


</pre>

<h2>Level 4</h2>

<p>Now let's plan our lives!

<p>Write a <tt>Planner</tt> class with an empty constructor to create an empty planner.
Include an <tt>add</tt> method to add a normal task or recurring task.

<pre>
$ javac your_java_files
$ jshell your_java_files_in_bottom-up_dependency_order
jshell&gt; Planner p = new Planner();
p ==&gt; 

jshell&gt; Task t = new Task(1,12,14,"lunch with boss")
t ==&gt; Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss

jshell&gt; p.add(t)
$18 ==&gt; 
Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss

jshell&gt; p
p ==&gt; 

jshell&gt; p = p.add(t)
p ==&gt; 
Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss

jshell&gt; p = p.add(new Task(3,16,18,"dinner with spouse"))
p ==&gt; 
Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss
Task: 3,16,18,dinner with spouse

jshell&gt; t = new Task(3,7,8,"fetch kids to school")
t ==&gt; Task: 3,7,8,fetch kids to school

jshell&gt; p = p.add(new RecurringTask(t,1,5))
p ==&gt; 
Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss
Task: 3,16,18,dinn ... 7,7,8,fetch kids to school

jshell&gt; p = p.add(new Task(3,14,15,"nap").cancel())
p ==&gt; 
Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss
Task: 3,16,18,dinn ... sk: 3,14,15,nap[cancelled]

jshell&gt; System.out.println(p.toString())

Task: 1,12,14,lunch with boss
Task: 3,16,18,dinner with spouse
Recurring Task: 3,7,8,fetch kids to school
#1:Task: 3,7,8,fetch kids to school
#2:Task: 4,7,8,fetch kids to school
#3:Task: 5,7,8,fetch kids to school
#4:Task: 6,7,8,fetch kids to school
#5:Task: 7,7,8,fetch kids to school
Task: 3,14,15,nap[cancelled]
</pre>

<p>There is no need to check for clashes (it just shows how hectic life can be).
Moreover, cancelled tasks are also included.

<h2>Level 5</h2>

<p>There are different ways to view the planner, say on a daily or weekly basis; here
we shall just define a daily view.

<p>An interface <tt>View</tt> is defined below:

<pre>
interface View {
    void view(ImList<...> tasks); // the ... depends on your implementation
}
</pre>

Define a class <tt>DayView</tt> with a constructor that takes in a particular day, and
an implementation of the <tt>view</tt> method that provides a view of the daily schedule for that day.
You should print out the tasks for that day in chronological order.
You should also ignore all cancelled tasks.

<pre>
$ javac your_java_files
$ jshell your_java_files_in_bottom-up_dependency_order
jshell&gt; p.view(new DayView(3))
Task: 3,7,8,fetch kids to school
Task: 3,16,18,dinner with spouse
</pre>
