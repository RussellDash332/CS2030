<h4 id="problem-description">Problem Description</h4>
<p>We have a Web API online for querying bus services and bus stops in Singapore. You can go ahead and try:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="uri" href="https://cs2030-bus-api.herokuapp.com/bus_services/96">https://cs2030-bus-api.herokuapp.com/bus_services/96</a> returns the list of bus stops (id followed by description) served by Bus 96.</li>
<li><a class="uri" href="https://cs2030-bus-api.herokuapp.com/bus_stops/16189">https://cs2030-bus-api.herokuapp.com/bus_stops/16189</a> returns the description of the stop followed by a list of bus services that serve the stop.</li>
</ul>
<p>(note: our database is two years old though -- don't rely on this for your daily commute!)</p>
<p>In this lab, we will write a program that uses the Web API to do the following:</p>
<p>Given the current stop <code>S</code>, and a search string <code>Q</code>, returns the list of buses serving <code>S</code> that also serves any stop with description containing <code>Q</code>. For instance, given <code>16189</code> and <code>Clementi</code>, the program will output</p>
<pre><code>Search for: 16189 &lt;-&gt; Clementi:

<p>A working program has been written and is available <a href="https://codecrunch.comp.nus.edu.sg/taskfile.php/4883/bus_skeleton.zip">here</a>. Download and study the program to understand what it does and how it works. Keep a copy of program around for comparison and reference later.</p>
<p>The given program is written synchronously. Every query to the Web API is done one-by-one, and the program has to wait until one query completes before it can continue execution of the program. As a result, the program is slower than it should be.</p>
<h4 id="the-task">The Task</h4>
<p>Your task, for this lab, is to change the given program so that it executes asynchronously. Doing so can significantly speed up the program.</p>
<p>The root of synchronous Web API access can be found in the method <code>httpGet</code> in <code>BusAPI.java</code>, in which the invocation of method <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/HttpClient.html#send(java.net.http.HttpRequest,java.net.http.HttpResponse.BodyHandler)"><code>send</code></a> from the class <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/HttpClient.html"><code>HttpClient</code></a> is done synchronously (i.e., it blocks until the response returns).<br> <code>HttpClient</code> also provides an asynchronous version of <code>send</code> called <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/HttpClient.html#sendAsync(java.net.http.HttpRequest,java.net.http.HttpResponse.BodyHandler)"><code>sendAsync</code></a>, which is exactly the same as <code>send</code> except that it is asynchronous and returns a <code>CompletableFuture&gt;</code> instead of <code>HttpResponse</code>. (You do not need to get into the nitty-gritty details of the <code>HttpClient</code> and <code>HttpResponse</code> for this lab -- but they are still good to know, so read up about them at your leisure).</p>
<p>To make the program synchronous, you should first change the invocation of <code>send</code> in <code>BusAPI</code> to <code>sendAsync</code>. All other changes will be triggered by this.</p>
<p>It is important to note that your should not call <code>CompletableFuture::join</code> prematurely, so that everything that has been <strong>promised</strong> so far, from the lower-level Web API calls to the higher-level logic of searching for bus services, are done asynchronously. The only place where you should <code>join</code> is in the <code>main()</code> method after waiting for all the <code>CompletableFuture</code> objects to complete using <code>allOf</code>. The final step would then be to print out the description of the bus routes found.</p>
<p>The speed-up you would experience for the asynchronous version depends on the complexity of the inputs. For the following test input:</p>
<pre><code>08031 Orchard
17009 NUS
17009 MRT
15131 Stn
08031 Int
12345 Dummy</code></pre>
<p>a typical reduction in the time from around 150-180 seconds to 10-15 seconds (i.e. more than 10 times speed up) is expected. Your milage may vary, but you should see some speed up in the total query time.</p>
<p>This task is divided into several levels. Read through all the levels to see how the different levels are related.</p>
<p>Remember to: * always compile your program files first before either using <code>jshell</code> to test your program, or using <code>java</code> to run your program * run <code>checkstyle</code> on your code</p>
<p>For this lab, you are also required to write <code>javadoc</code> comments and make sure you can generate the <code>javadoc</code> HTML files. You are not required to submit the <code>javadoc</code> HTML files, but they will be generated later based on your code.</p>

<h4 id="level-1-busapi.java">Level 1: <code>BusAPI.java</code></h4>
<p>Start by changing the method call <code>HttpClient::send</code> to <code>HttpClient::sendAsync</code> in the method <code>httpGet</code>. In the skeleton code provided, notice that as soon as the <code>send</code> method returns with a <code>HttpResponse</code>, it proceeds to check the status. Since the <code>send</code> could take a long time to complete, we would have to wait for it to complete first.</p>
<p>On the other hand, using <code>sendAsync</code> returns a response wrapped within a <code>CompletableFuture</code>; it is a <strong>promise</strong> that a response will be returned (not now, but eventually). The part of the code that deals with the response can now be attached as a callback to this <code>CompletableFuture</code>.</p>
<p>Modify the <code>BusAPI.java</code> program such that sending a <code>http</code> request is now done asynchronously. You will also need to modify the <code>getBusStopsServedBy</code> and <code>getBusServicesAt</code> methods accordingly.</p>
<p>Compile your java program as follows:</p>
<pre><code>$ javac -Xlint:rawtypes BusAPI.java</code></pre>
<p>Once compiled, you can update the given <a href="https://codecrunch.comp.nus.edu.sg/taskfile.php/4883/level1.jar">jar</a> file and test your program.</p>
<pre><code>$ jar uf level1.jar *.class
$ echo "16189 Clementi" | java -jar level1.jar
Search for: 16189  &lt;-&gt; Clementi:

<h4 id="level-2-busservice.java">Level 2: <code>BusService.java</code>

<p>Now compile the <code>BusService.java</code> class:</p>
<pre><code>$ javac -Xlint:rawtypes BusService.java</code></pre>
<p>and take note of the compilation errors. Specifically, the <code>getBusStops</code> method should now return a <strong>promise</strong> of a <code>Set</code>.</p>
<p>In this case, as soon as <code>BusAPI::getBusStopsServedBy</code> method completes, a <code>Scanner object</code> can then be created to proceed with reading user input.</p>
<p>Likewise, modify the <code>findStopsWith</code> method accordingly.</p>

<h4 id="level-3-bussg.java-and-busroute.java">Level 3: <code>BusSg.java</code> and <code>BusRoutes.java</code></h4>
<p>Within the <code>BusSg</code> class, modify the <code>getBusServices</code> method to return a <strong>promise</strong> of a <code>Set</code>. In addition, the <code>findBusServicesBetween</code> method needs to be modified accordingly. This will trigger a change in the constructor of the <code>BusRoutes</code> class.</p>
<p>Within the <code>BusRoutes</code> class, the <code>Map</code> of bus services should now map a bus service to a <strong>promise</strong> of a <code>Set</code>. When generating the description of the bus route, the original method goes through the bus services with the route, and for each bus service, it obtains a set of matching bus-stops and calls <code>decribeService</code> to return a <code>String</code> representing the bus service and its matching stops. With the new implementation, the set of matching bus-stops is now a <strong>promise</strong>. You will need to be able to combine these <strong>promises</strong> together, and return the string representation of the bus route as a <strong>promise</strong>.</p>
<p>Compile your java program as follows:</p>
